# HoloLensUnity
AR development using Unity (2.1 and up) and HoloLens.

Imported files:
MixedRealityToolKit from Microsoft

Tools Installed: 

HoloLens Emulator : 
This is optional but very handy whether you do not have a HoloLens but want to learn AR dev for HoloLens, or if you are in a group project and have only one HoloLens.
Also, the Emulator does not work with Windows Home as we need Hyper-V. If you have Windows Pro, Education or Entreprise, you should be good to go.

Softwares: 

Unity 2.1 and up

Visual Studio Community 2015 or 2017
