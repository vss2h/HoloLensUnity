# HoloLensUnity
AR development using Unity 2.1 and HoloLens.

Imported files:
MixedRealityToolKit from Microsoft

Tools Installed: 

HoloLens Emulator : 
This is optional but very handy whether you do not have a HoloLens but want to learn AR dev for HoloLens, or if you are in a group project and have only one HoloLens.
Also, the Emulator does not work with Windows Home as we need Hyper-V. If you have Windows Pro, Education or Entreprise, you should be good to go.

Softwares: 

Unity 2.1:
I am using 2.1 because the oldest release of the MRTK is 2.1.1. Having an newer version of Unity will not be compatible and will only crash.

Visual Studio Community 2017
